# Welcome to my random quote project!

The goal of this project was to practice my javascript as well as to become familar with using Git/Github. 
I have learned a lot about version control through this and see how it can be very efficient for a project. 

## What the code does!

This code will give you three random quotes from characters that were in The Office. If you enjoy The Office as much as I do I'm sure you will get a smile out of this. :smile:
